1. Assignment 1 contains exercises relating to sampling and quantization.
The programming exercise is to implement an interactive tool to scale and anti-alias an input RGB image. We also have to implement an interactive 
scaled or magnified lookup around the mouse position. As the mouse pointer moves over the image, an appropriately scaled circular area is displayed around the mouse pointer.
This scaled circular region is at the same contrast level while the rest of the image is at a lower contrast level.

2. Assignment 2 deals with media compression techniques. 
The programming assignment is to simulate image encoding-decoding using the JPEG standard, which in turn is based on a transform image coding technique
that uses the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). The three modes of delivery using the compressed DCT coefficients: baseline (scanline), progressive mode -
spectral selection and progressive mode - successive bit approximation, have been simulated. A latency parameter has been incorporated, that simulates communications
a different bandwidths.
